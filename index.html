    <h2>Why I make art</h2> 
    <p> My mom once told me <q>Favour, you're going to do great things with your artwork</q><br/>
    I never took to mind what she said until now, now that I am planning for college and deciding <br/>
    What I aspire to in my future is to further develop my art skills.</p>  
    <hr/> 
    <p>I believe that I am a <b>philocalist</b>. I find the beauty and art in all things.<br/>
    I like to say <i>c'est la vie</i> (meaning 
    <q>that's life</q>).</p>
