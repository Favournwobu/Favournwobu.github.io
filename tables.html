    <h2>Let's analyze what we learned!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hog bristle brushes are perfect for applying thick layers of paint to your</br>
      paintings with rather thin transparent layers.</li>
      <li>Synthetic brushes are more effective when it comes to creating a painting with </br>
      a lot of fine details.</li>
      <li>Both hog and synthetic brushes are compatible and most recommended for oil painting</br>
      Synthetic brushes allow for a smooth finish, while hob brushes allow for a textured finish</li>
    </ul>
